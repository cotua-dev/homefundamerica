      What is an Investor Bank Statement Loan?
    </h2>
    <strong>
      In short, we use 2 years of personal or business bank statements and a P & L (profit and loss) statement to verify proof of income, instead of tax returns.

      MBANC understands what it means to own a business.
                We know that owning a small business, start-up, or
                having another form of untraditional income makes
                homeownership a more difficult feat. That's why we
                offer this flexible mortgage program to sidestep some
                of those challenges and create a clear path to ownership.

      What Are Jumbo and Super Jumbo Loans?
    </h2>
    <p>
      
                        Jumbo and Super Jumbo Loans offer the flexibility of
                        borrowing with less restrictions. They can be used to
                        finance primary residences, second or vacation homes,
                        and investment properties. A Jumbo Loan may also be
                        the right option when refinancing an existing home
                        loan or consolidating multiple mortgages into a single
                        loan.

                        A mortgage is generally considered a Jumbo Loan when it
                        exceeds the conforming loan limit, $510,400 in most U.S
                        countries, set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Super Jumbo
                        Loans usually include mortgage amounts over $1 million.

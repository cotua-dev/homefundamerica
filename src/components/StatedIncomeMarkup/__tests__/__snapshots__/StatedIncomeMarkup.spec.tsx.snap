      What is a Stated Income Loan?
    </h2>
    <strong>
      Stated Income Loan programs are for self-employed and business owners with incomes that are difficult to document. MBANC states your income and backstops them with bank statements.
    </strong>
    <p>
      Instead of simply stating what you make, MBANC will ask for at least 12 months of bank statements, maybe 24, to determine your income. These can be personal bank statements, business bank statements, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      MBANC will then calculate your monthly income by averaging
                those deposits over the accompanying 12- or 24-month period.
                If you're a self-employed borrower, you may also be asked to
                provide a Profit and Loss Statement (P&L) that substantiates
                the deposits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, everything needs to make sense, and any large deposits will be flagged and require explanation. In other words, taking out a loan or having someone make deposits into your bank account will likely be noticed/scrutinized by the underwriter.
    </p>
    <strong>
      We use 100% of the deposits for Business and Personal Bank Statements.

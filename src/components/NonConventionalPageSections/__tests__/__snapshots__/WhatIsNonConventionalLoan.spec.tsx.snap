      What is a Non-Conventional Loan?
    </h2>
    <p>
      
                        A non-conventional loan is a mortgage that doesn't meet the
                        guidelines for a conventional loan set by Fannie Mae and
                        Freddie Mac. Often a loan is classified as non-conventional
                        because the loan amount exceeds the conventional limit, which
                        is $484,350 in most U.S counties. In addition to higher
                        loan amounts, non-conventional loans from Manhattan Banc can
                        offer expanded down-payment and credit qualification options.

                        regarding allegations of copyright infringement occurring
                        on the Site or with the Service. Company has adopted a
                        policy that provides for the immediate suspension and/or
                        termination of any Site or Service user who is found to

                        allegations of copyright infringement brought to its
                        attention. If you have evidence, know, or have a good faith
                        belief that your rights or the rights of a third party have
                        been violated and you want Company to delete, edit, or
                        disable the material in question, you must provide Company
                        with all of the following information: (a) a physical or
                        electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf
                        of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly
                        infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed
                        to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works
                        are covered by a single notification, a representative list
                        of such works; (c) identification of the material that is
                        claimed to be infringed or to be the subject of infringing
                        activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to
                        be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit
                        Company to locate the material; (d) information reasonably
                        sufficient to permit Company to contact you, such as an address,
                        telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address
                        at which you may be contacted; (e) a statement that you have
                        a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
                        complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
                        agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information
                        in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
                        that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
                        exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. For this notification
                        to be effective, you must provide it to Company’s designated
                        agent at:

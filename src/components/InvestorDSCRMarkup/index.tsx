            <h2>What is an Investor DSCR Loan?</h2>
            <strong>
                This program is perfect for flexible investors who are
                self-employed or have other unique financial profiles.
                All we need to look at for your rental properties is a
                lease agreement, or income of the property.
            </strong>
            <p>
                MBANC will qualify you based on the cash flow of the
                property and not your individual income on your tax
                return
            </p>
            <strong>How is DSCR calculated?</strong>
            <p>
                The debt service coverage ratio is defined as the Net
                Operating Income (NOI) divided by Annual Debt Service
                on the proposed loan. Debt service is just a fancy word
                that means the loan payments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income / Annual
                Debt Service
            </p>

      What is an Investor DSCR Loan?
    </h2>
    <strong>
      This program is perfect for flexible investors who are self-employed or have other unique financial profiles. All we need to look at for your rental properties is a lease agreement, or income of the property.
    </strong>
    <p>
      MBANC will qualify you based on the cash flow of the property and not your individual income on your tax return
    </p>
    <strong>
      How is DSCR calculated?
    </strong>
    <p>
      The debt service coverage ratio is defined as the Net Operating Income (NOI) divided by Annual Debt Service on the proposed loan. Debt service is just a fancy word that means the loan payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income / Annual Debt Service
    </p>

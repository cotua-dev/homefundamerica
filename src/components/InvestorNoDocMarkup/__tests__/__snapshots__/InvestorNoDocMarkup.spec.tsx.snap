      What is an Investor No Doc Loan?
    </h2>
    <strong>
      Allows an investor to purchase or refinance a
                home without jumping through all the hoops of
                providing income doucmentation. It's based solely
                on the merit of the credit score of the client
                and LTV. It is ideal for investors with multiple
                properties or an investor who doesn't want to go
                through the headache of documenting income.

      What is a Conventional Loan?
    </h2>
    <p>
      
                        A conventional loan is a mortgage that follows the guidelines
                        set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These government-sponsored
                        companies help provide lenders with the money they need to
                        make home loans. Loan size, limited to $484,350 in most U.S.
                        counties, is the most well-known requirement for conventional
                        loans. Loans that don't meet the standards set are called
                        Non-Conventional Loans.

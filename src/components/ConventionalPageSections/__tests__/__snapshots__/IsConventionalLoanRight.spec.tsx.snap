      Is a Conventional Loan right for you?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Conventional Loans are often well-suited for borrowers with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Loan amounts that fall within conventional loan limits
      </li>
      <li>
        Good or excellent credit
      </li>
      <li>
        Easy-to-document income
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      
                        Want a loan with more flexibility? A government-backed FHA mortgage
                        could be a better fit. After you apply, we'll review all of your
                        mortgage options with you.

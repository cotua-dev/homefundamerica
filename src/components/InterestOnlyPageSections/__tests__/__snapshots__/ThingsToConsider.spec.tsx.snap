      Things to Consider with Interest-Only Mortgages
    </h2>
    <p>
      
                        Interest-Only Mortgages can provide some unique benefits,
                        but they are not right for everyone.

                        Things to be conscious of when considering an interest-only
                        option:
                    
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The interest-only payment does not pay down the principal balance
      </li>
      <li>
        The monthly payment following the interest-only period will be higher than that of a fully amortized loan that was originated at the same time
      </li>
      <li>
        The monthly payment will increase after the initial interest-only term ends
      </li>
    </ul>

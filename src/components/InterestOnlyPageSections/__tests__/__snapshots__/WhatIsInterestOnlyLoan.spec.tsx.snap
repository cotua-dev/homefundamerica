      What Is an Interest-Only Mortgage?
    </h2>
    <p>
      
                        An Interest-Only Mortgage is a home loan that
                        gives you the option to pay only the interest
                        on the principal amount for a set period of
                        time. After the interest-only term is over,
                        the payment converts to a principal-and-interest
                        payment that is fully amortized over the remaining
                        term of the mortgage.
